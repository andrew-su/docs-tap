### <a id='1-8-0-new-features'></a> v1.8.0 New features by component and area

This release includes the following changes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-8-0-vscode'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code

- You can create `portforwards` with the [Tanzu: Portforward](vscode-extension/using-the-extension.hbs.md#workload-port-forward)
  action from the pop-up menu in the Tanzu panel. This enables you to easily access the application
  when iterating locally from a local URL (via **Tanzu: Portforward**) or a Knative URL (for the web
  type of workloads) from the Tanzu panel.

#### <a id='1-8-0-intellij'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

- You can create `portforwards` with the [Port Forward](vscode-extension/using-the-extension.hbs.md#workload-port-forward)
  action from the pop-up menu in the Tanzu panel. This enables you to easily access the application
  when iterating locally from a local URL (via **Port Forward**) or a Knative URL (for the web
  type of workloads) from the Tanzu panel.

#### <a id='1-8-0-app-sso'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Application Single Sign-On

- The authorization server can auto-discover upstream identity provider
  configuration from
  `AuthServer.spec.identityProviders[].openID.configurationURI`.
  For more information, see [Identity providers for Application Single Sign-On](app-sso/how-to-guides/service-operators/identity-providers.hbs.md).

- The `userinfo` endpoint of an upstream identity provider is called when
  it's known and configured with the scope `openid`. That means user information
  is retrieved for non-standard providers.

- Scopes in the token response are filtered according to the roles filtering
  defined on the `AuthServer`.

- Advertises the Application Single Sign-On version on components:

  - The controller workloads are annotated with
    `sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/version`.
  - `AuthServer`-owned workloads are annotated with
    `sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/version`.
  - Authorization servers report the version by using the endpoint
    `FDQN/actuator/info`.

- Shows an error message when attempting unsupported, Relying Party (RP)-Initiated Logout.

- Shows an improved error message when using `localhost` in
  `ClientRegistration.spec.redirectURIs`.

- Bundles the latest `bitnami/redis:7.2.4`.

- Supports Kubernetes v1.29.

#### <a id='1-8-0-aws-services'></a> v1.8.0 Features: AWS Services

- Adds the service Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ. To enable the new service, set `rabbitmq.enabled: true`
  in your `aws-services-values.yaml`. For more configuration options, see
  [Package values for AWS Services](aws-services/reference/package-values.hbs.md).

- Adds the package value `crossplane.role_arn`. Users can specify a `role_arn`, which causes
  the Provider pods to run as a service account that is mapped to the corresponding IAM role in AWS.

- Updates upbound/provider-aws from v0.39.0 to v0.46.0.

#### <a id='1-8-0-bitnami-services'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Bitnami Services

- Updates all Compositions to use function pipelines rather than Crossplaneâ€™s default patch and transform.
  New instances created using a class claim are now composed using the new Compositions.
  There is no change to how the resulting composed service instances operate.
  There is no impact to existing instances.

#### <a id='1-8-0-buildpacks'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Buildpacks and Stacks

- Adds a new stack - The [`Tanzu Standard Stack for UBI 8`](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/services/tanzu-buildpacks/GUID-stacks.html#ubi-8-stacks), along with a builder as part of the [`full`](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.7/tap/tanzu-build-service-dependencies.html#lite-vs-full) dependencies.

- Adds a new stack - The [`Tanzu Static Stack for Ubuntu 22.04`](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/services/tanzu-buildpacks/GUID-stacks.html#ubuntu-stacks), along with a builder as part of the [`full`](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.7/tap/tanzu-build-service-dependencies.html#lite-vs-full) dependencies.

- Adds support for [.NET 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8) in the Tanzu .NET Core Buildpack.

  can use this function without having to explicitly install it.

#### <a id='1-8-0-service-bindings'></a> v1.8.0 Features: Service Bindings

- Updates [servicebinding/runtime](https://github.com/servicebinding/runtime) to v0.7.0.

### <a id='1-8-0-resolved-issues'></a> v1.8.0 Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by component and area, are resolved in this release.

#### <a id='1-8-0-COMPONENT-NAME-ri'></a> v1.8.0 Resolved issues: Service Bindings

- Resolved an issue in which `ServiceBinding` is not immediately reconciled when `status.binding.name`
  changes on a previously bound service resource.

#### <a id='1-8-0-scst-store-ri'></a> v1.8.0 Resolved issues: Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

- This release fixes the issue with expired certificates where you must restart the metadata-store pods when the internal database certificate is rotated by cert-manager.
You will no longer see this issue with the default internal database, but the solution does not cover the case of an external database.

- Artifact Metadata Repository now properly sets the `hasNextPage` to `false` when there are
no more items to be retrieved during a paginated query. This fixes the issue
where the last page always returns an empty list.
